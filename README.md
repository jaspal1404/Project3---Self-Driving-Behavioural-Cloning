# Project3---Self-Driving-Behavioural-Cloning

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

  1. Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
  
  2. Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
  
  3. Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
  
  4. Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
  
  5. Summarize the results with a written report


My project includes the following files:

  1. model.py - actual code defining the model architecture, preprocessing and training steps
  
  2. drive.py - code for driving the car in autonomous mode on the simulator
  
  3. model.h5 - contains a pre trained convolution neural network 

  4. video_final - output from the final version of the trained model 

  5. video_initial - output from same model trained on initial training data (added to show transition of improved autonomous driving using      recovery lane driving in training data)
