# Project3---Self-Driving-Behavioural-Cloning

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

  1.Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
  
  2.Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
  
  3.Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
  
  4.Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
  
  5.Summarize the results with a written report


video_final - output from the final version of the trained model 

video_initial - output from same model trained on initial training data (added to show transition of improved autonomous driving using recovery lane driving in training data)
